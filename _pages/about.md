Welcome! My name is Jorden Jolley. I am currently a student at Columbia University in the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/"> CS@CU MS Bridge Program.</a> 
I have started my masters coursework concurrently and will graduate in 2023 with a <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/">MS in Computer Science</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/softwareSystems/"> Software Systems track</a>.
I am currently seeking software engineering internships for summer 2023.


<h2> Background </h2>
I was born and raised in Arlington, Texas.
In 2018, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BBA in <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/departments/irom/degree-programs/undergraduate/mis/">Management Information Systems.</a>
<br><br>
During my time in college, I worked at <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> for two summers on the teaching team.
I also worked as a software development intern at <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW.</a>
<br><br>
After college, I moved from Austin to Houston, bought an Astros t-shirt, and began working for ExxonMobil.
After three years as a business analyst, I learned I was most passionate about my most technical work.
I desired a way to pivot out of my current industry, role, and location, and graduate school was the ticket.
I quit my job in order to continue to deepen my technical knowledge and broaden my CS skills through a more formal program.
<br><br>
Bridging the gender gap in STEM is one of my passions; I came back to GWC this summer (2022) as a teacher and taught over 100 high school girls programming throughout the summer!

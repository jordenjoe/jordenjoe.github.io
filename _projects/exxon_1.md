## XTO to UPST Domain Upgrade
* Project was implementing a model for hosting both UPST and XOM users on the application using a system of staging databases and the software that populates each set based on who is leaving/joining the company based on what AD groups they are on.
* Tasks I specifically worked on included creating automated scripts for moving users over, staging and testing applications on the new server, working with DBAs and XOM security teams to update security on our new databases (including an AD group cleanup subproject), and helping manage rollover weekend.

## Reporting Projects

* 2020 - Collaborated with Wellview admins to lead a large-scale troubleshooting effort to create and test 74 report distributions to hundreds of users and revamped the historical reporting structure to consolidate reports by analyzing metadata on reporting usage and requesting end-user feedback. These efforts required strong analytical skills and resulted in streamlining reports from 170+ to 90, substantially decreasing upkeep time.

### Crystal Reports to SSRS Conversion 

 
* Executed and oversaw the SSRS conversion project by creating the backend reporting solution on Visual Studio and working with DBAs and web developers to create the updated Wellview Reporting web server front end, bringing value to end users by deploying a modern GUI.

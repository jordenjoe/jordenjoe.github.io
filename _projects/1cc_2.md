Created a photo album web application that can be searched using AWS's Transcribe NLP (through both text and voice). Lex disambiguates the query. Query your photos for people, objects, actions, landmarks and more. You can add custom labels to identify your photos with your own indexes. 

As you can see from the video, the frontend interface was not the focus; functionality and the backend was the focus for the project. 

The web app is now disabled since running the services cost $, but there's a video showing functionality below!

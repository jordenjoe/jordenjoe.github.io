Course was UI/UX Design focused, so Figma was the primary focus with React implementation semi-functional (clickable with some features implemented, but limited.) Although it was designed as an app, we were instructed to implement with React instead of a native app design tool. 

Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/jordenjoe/suitemates) or [try out the design.](https://jordenjoe.github.io/suitemates/)

Tech: React, HTML, CSS, Figma

Personal contributions: Implemented landing pages, login and create/join suite functionality, and home page in React. Designed landing pages, login and create/join suite functionality, rent, and suite pages in Figma.

Worked with Aparna Rajesh, Josephine Chan, Ava Kim.

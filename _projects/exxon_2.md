  * 2021 - Created WV - IPES SAP integration for Argentina division. collaborated with team in Argentina to create outline for their request and built out the entire SQL integration between Wellview and IPES. Managed deployment for users, impacting ~100 wells.

  * 2021 - Created SAP integration USA documentation (spreadsheet, diagrams, and data visualizations that act as a guide to the complex SAP integration). Heavily analytical. Fast paced project timeline due to resourcing.

  * 2020 - Created root cause analysis document for Wellview/Siteview daily cost integration by investigating the process pain points, including causing duplicated records overestimating costs by millions. Developed a two-step solution and presented to the admins at the first 2019 Wellview Admin Conference.

  * 2020 - Implemented solution by writing scripts to link SV to WV using the Peloton solution instead of a custom integration, benefitting the business by simplifying the integration tool and creating direct links between sites and wells through the SVWELL table instead of using repeating IDWELL/IDSITES. In the process, tested and deployed scripts to fix the cost duplication records, providing more accurate costs for the business.

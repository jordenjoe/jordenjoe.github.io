* Designed and created original logo and slogan designs for ExxonMobil at GHC. "Girls fuel the future". Learned Adobe Illustrator to create 8 prototypes and collaborated with the UX Design team, implementing feedback and finally compiling top designs to present for approval from XOM PR. In addition, created price comparison spreadsheets and organized the purchase and delivery of 200+ shirts.
 
* Feedback on these efforts included attendees seeking out our booth to check out our branding, resulting in great brand uplift for ExxonMobil.

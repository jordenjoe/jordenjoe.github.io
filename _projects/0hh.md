Created as final project for Visual Interfaces course.

Python program for teaching a user good handwriting by evaluating and providing feedback on images of their handwriting, following prompts.

- Automate the feedback process, applying real-life teaching strategies and research-backed handwriting guidelines.
- Program prompts user to enter an acceptance threshold and write a letter 5 times in a row on paper
- User upload photo to receive feedback
- Program provides feedback on letter thickness, spacing, identifiability, skew, and size
- Continue through all letters, repeating same letter until you meet threshold

Main challenge on the project was building the feedback system for identification, skew, and thickness.

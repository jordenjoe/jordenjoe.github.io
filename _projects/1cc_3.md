Finding empty parking spots in parking lots attached to places that see a lot of traffic (like malls and stores in large cities) can be a challenging and time-consuming process, especially if the parking lots are large. 

GoParkMe provides a solution by helping users find empty parking spots quickly and easily using image recognition techniques on images retrieved from a livestream video. 

The application is accessible by users through a frontend that shows users which parking spaces are vacant, decreasing the time users waste finding parking and increasing time spent shopping in malls and stores. GoParkMe's AWS-based architecture gives it scalability, speed, and high availability.

Created a chatbot which uses Yelp data to recommend restaurants to users based on their requirements. It was my first time using AWS.

Chatbox is now disabled since running the services cost $, but there's a video showing functionality below!

Tech: AWS Lambda (Python), IAM, Lex, SQS, DynamoDB, S3
Worked with Hikaru Ikebe.

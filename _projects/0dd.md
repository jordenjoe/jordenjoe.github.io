Created as final project for Engineering Software as a Service course.

Data analytics can be expensive, time consuming, and confusing. DataDave makes it simple for non-technical users or small business owners to quickly analyze their data.

Datadave not only will generate sql queries for you, but also runs the query on your input table to generate and output results. It can also handle ambiguous, non-SQL questions about your data.

Tech: Ruby on Rails, Sqllite, Rspec & Cucumber testing, Bootstrap, OpenAI API

Notable contributions: 
- Developed architecture and dataflow for application
- Created form and integration with SQLLite for dynamic table creation (workaround for ActiveRecord due to the old rails version the class required)
- Query engineering with OpenAI API 
- Built tests with Rspec and Cucumber
Worked with Anna-Samsara Daefler, Nick Luo, Aparna Rajesh

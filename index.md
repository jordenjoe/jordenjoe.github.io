Welcome! My name is Jorden Jolley. I am currently a student at Columbia University getting an [MS in Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/) in the [Software Systems track](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/softwareSystems). Previously, I completed the [CS@CU MS Bridge Program](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/). I graduated in winter 2023. I am currently seeking a full-time software engineering role.


Background 
=====
In 2018, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BBA in [Management Information Systems](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/departments/irom/degree-programs/undergraduate/mis/). My goal is to create clean, data-driven software that serves people and makes their lives better; I am an engineer with a collaborative spirit who knows how to communicate with my teams.
<br>
During my time in college, I worked at [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) for two summers on the teaching team.
I also worked as a software development intern at [SXSW.](https://www.sxsw.com/)
<br>

After college, I moved from Austin to Houston, bought an Astros t-shirt, and began working for ExxonMobil.
After three years as a business analyst, I learned I was most passionate about my most technical work.
I desired a way to pivot out of my current industry, role, and location, and graduate school was the ticket.
I quit my job in order to continue to deepen my technical knowledge and broaden my CS skills through a more formal program.
<br>

Bridging the gender gap in STEM is one of my passions; I worked at Girls Who Code as a teacher and taught over 100 high school girls programming throughout the summer 2022!
<br>

Most recently, I worked as a software engineering intern on the Webkiosk Enrollments team at CLEAR, where I worked on a React devtools application.

Welcome! My name is Jorden Jolley. I am currently a student at Columbia University in the [CS@CU MS Bridge Program.](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge/) 
I have started my masters coursework concurrently and will graduate in 2023 with a [MS in Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/) in the [Software Systems track](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/softwareSystems).
I am currently seeking software engineering internships for summer 2023.


Background 
=====
I was born and raised in Arlington, Texas.
In 2018, I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BBA in [Management Information Systems](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/departments/irom/degree-programs/undergraduate/mis/)
<br>
During my time in college, I worked at [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) for two summers on the teaching team.
I also worked as a software development intern at [SXSW.](https://www.sxsw.com/)
<br>

After college, I moved from Austin to Houston, bought an Astros t-shirt, and began working for ExxonMobil.
After three years as a business analyst, I learned I was most passionate about my most technical work.
I desired a way to pivot out of my current industry, role, and location, and graduate school was the ticket.
I quit my job in order to continue to deepen my technical knowledge and broaden my CS skills through a more formal program.
<br>

Bridging the gender gap in STEM is one of my passions; I came back to GWC this summer (2022) as a teacher and taught over 100 high school girls programming throughout the summer!
